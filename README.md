# MQTT-like-application
This project was an optional part of the course Internet of Things I attended at Politecnico di Milano. Together with a classmate we designed and implemented a lightweight publish-subscribe application protocol similar to MQTT. We have implemented it using TinyOS while the simulations were realized with TOSSIM.
